   Following the MVC design pattern, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
  


Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

  ## Installation Instuctions
  run server.js in the terminal

  ## Usage Information
  Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.
  Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
